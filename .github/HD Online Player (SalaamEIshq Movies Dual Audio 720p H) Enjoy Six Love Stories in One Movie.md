3. Vinay and Seema: A married couple who have a dull and boring life, until Vinay meets Anjali, a young and attractive journalist who wants to interview him.
4. Ashutosh and Tehzeeb: A TV anchor who loses his memory in a car accident and forgets his wife Tehzeeb, a singer who suffers from multiple sclerosis.
5. Raju and Stephanie: A taxi driver who falls in love with a foreigner who comes to India to find her boyfriend, but faces language and cultural barriers.
6. Ramdayal and Phoolwati: A newlywed couple who are still virgins and face pressure from their families and friends to consummate their marriage.

## What are the Reviews of Salaam-E-Ishq Movie?
  
Salaam-E-Ishq received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike. Some praised the movie for its star cast, music, cinematography and entertainment value, while others criticized it for its length, lack of originality, weak script and direction. The movie was also compared unfavorably with Love Actually, which was considered to be superior in terms of storytelling, humor and emotion. The movie also failed to perform well at the box office, despite having a huge budget and hype.
  
Some of the positive reviews of the movie are:

- "Salaam-E-Ishq is an ode to love, a celebration of love, a film that salutes love... The six stories are interwoven with each other at some point in the narrative. It puts the spotlight on six couples in different parts of the world and in different stages of their lives... Salaam-E-Ishq is an enjoyable fare that works primarily due to its interesting storyline." - Bollywood Hungama[^3^]
- "Salaam-e-Wonderful... A very nice heart touching film that I really enjoyed although I'm not very keen in romantic comedies especially in Hollywood. The film has six stories about six couples they are all told bit by bit all at the same time not one by one... My favourite story is Govinda's & Shannon's and the funniest story is Sohail Khan's & Isha Kopikar's. The best couple has to be John Abraham & Vida Balan." - IMDb user review[^1^]
- "Salute to love - Quality viewing... Salaam-E-Ishq tells an epic tale of six couples. Oblivious to one another and separated by miles of distance, they are tested by life's two eyes: Tribulation and Success. Yet somehow, through destiny and fate, these six couples are brought together by the phenomenon of love... Salman Khan has some magical element that no other ever has. His pairing with Priyanka is spot on....hopefully they do more projects together." - IMDb user review[^1^]

Some of the negative reviews of the movie are:

- "Salaam-e-Ishq is no great film, in fact not even a good film.But,still the film is fairly entertaining because of the presence of so many stars in the movie.This is definitely the USP of the movie.Despite the length of the film,it never bores the viewers solely because of the above reasons." - IMDb user review[^1^]
- "Nikhil Advani's second directorial venture 8cf37b1e13
