## How to avoid red light error on Samsung ML-1640 printer?
 
The red light error on Samsung ML-1640 printer indicates that the toner cartridge has reached its page limit and needs to be replaced. However, this does not mean that the toner cartridge is empty or defective. In fact, there may be still some toner left in the cartridge that can be used for printing more pages. To avoid the red light error and extend the life of your toner cartridge, you can try these tips:

- Use the Toner Save mode on your printer settings. This mode reduces the amount of toner used for each print, which can save up to 30% of toner.
- Print only what you need. Avoid printing unnecessary or duplicate pages, such as test pages, drafts, or blank pages.
- Use a lower print resolution. Higher resolutions use more toner than lower ones. You can adjust the print resolution on your printer settings or on your computer software.
- Clean the toner cartridge regularly. Dust and dirt can accumulate on the toner cartridge and affect its performance. You can use a soft cloth or a cotton swab to gently wipe the surface of the toner cartridge.
- Refill the toner cartridge manually. If you are confident and skilled enough, you can buy a compatible toner refill kit and refill the toner cartridge yourself. However, this may void your warranty and damage your printer if done incorrectly.

By following these tips, you can avoid the red light error on your Samsung ML-1640 printer and print more pages with your toner cartridge. However, if the red light error persists or if the print quality deteriorates, you may need to replace the toner cartridge with a new one.
