Lazarillo de Tormes is not only a literary masterpiece, but also a historical document that reflects the social and cultural reality of Spain in the 16th century. The novel exposes the hypocrisy and corruption of the institutions and the individuals that represented them, such as the church, the nobility, and the justice system. The novel also portrays the harsh conditions of life for the poor and marginalized sectors of society, such as orphans, beggars, and criminals.
 
The novel is divided into seven chapters or "treatises", each one narrating the experiences of Lazarillo with a different master. The first one is a blind man who teaches him how to survive by trickery and deception. The second one is a miserly priest who starves him and keeps a loaf of bread hidden in a chest. The third one is a nobleman who pretends to be rich but is actually poor and indebted. The fourth one is a friar who leads a dissolute and worldly life. The fifth one is a pardoner who sells fake relics and indulgences to the gullible people. The sixth one is a chaplain who hires him as a water carrier and pays him a meager salary. The seventh and final one is an archpriest who marries him to one of his servants and helps him to get a job as a town crier.
 
The novel ends with Lazarillo achieving a comfortable and respectable position in society, but at the cost of losing his innocence and integrity. He also reveals that he wrote his autobiography as a response to a letter from an anonymous friend who wanted to know about his life. He hopes that his friend will not judge him harshly for his actions, but rather understand that he had no choice but to adapt to the circumstances.
